## Introduction

The consultation note forms the basis of `IM1 Consultation Writeback` and `GP Connect Send Document`. It is also related to the EMIS consultation screen sections and [PRSB section headings](https://theprsb.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Guidance-on-specific-PRSB-sections-to-use.pdf).

## Informatics Model

The consultation note consists of three main structures:

- composition which forms the main body of the consultation
- archetype/template, which are a templated set of questions that can be used during a consultation. It will often be referred to as a form, and it is primarily a data capture method. Examples include
    - [vital signs](Questionnaire-VitalSigns.html)
    - [daily physical activity](Questionnaire-DailyPhysicalActivity.html)
- resource entities, which are the data structures persisted in the clinical repository. The most common resource will be:
    - [Observation](StructureDefinition-Observation.html)

<br clear="all">

Both archetype/template and entities are **data capture** related and will often relate to a data entry screen within an application. Compositions provide a high-level structure to the consultation, but they are generally assembled from both archetype/templates and resource entities; it is a **data aggregate**.

Many questions within the archetype / template will be the same and also overlap with directly captured entities. I.e., in remote patient monitoring (virtual wards) a patient's weight, pulse rate and blood pressure can be captured from device data. These data items also exist in [vital signs](Questionnaire-VitalSigns.html).

> Where a template/archetype question may have multiple uses, it is persisted as a resource entity.

These questions will be SNOMED or LOINC coded.

## Composition & FHIR Document

> [Composition - Consultation Note](StructureDefinition-ConsulationNote.html)

The basic structure of a composition is shown above, in its aggregated form it is known as a [FHIR Document]() and a redendered example is shown below:

### Comosition.section - Document Section Codes

Each section is coded using Document Section Codes, which can be found [Value Set: Document Section Codes](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/valueset-doc-section-codes.html).

## Domain Archetype

As composition is not for **data capture**, we need an archetype to form the high framework for the consulation-note.

The current model is shown below. Historically this is related to [SOAP Note](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP_note) and also [Nursing Process (ADPIE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing_process) which are also included for documentation purposes.
